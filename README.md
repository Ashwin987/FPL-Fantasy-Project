# FPL Project

A web scraper to extract data from a database of 2021-22 Fantasy Premier League footballers and all 380 match reports for the 2021-22 Premier League season.

## About the Project
The goal of the project is to determine how we can make defensive midfielders valuable picks in Fantasy Premier League. Since they tend not to register many goal contributions, they usually only gain 1-2 points for playing minutes, 1 point for a clean sheet, and minus points for yellow or red cards. As a result, defensive midfielders are often avoided in FPL. If users do select them for their fantasy teams, it is mainly to serve as a cheap bench option that can make more funds available for premium attacking players.
